JavaScript Hoisting: Hoisting is JavaScript's default behavior of moving declarations to the top.

JavaScript Declarations are Hoisted
In JavaScript, a variable can be declared after it has been used.

In other words; a variable can be used before it has been declared.

var a; = variable declaration
a=10, = variable initialiazation

Hoisting example: 

var a =10;
document.write(a);
var b=20;

compile phase:

var a;
var b;
a=10;
document.write(a);
b=20;
