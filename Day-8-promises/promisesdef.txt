 Promise Defination : Promises are used to handle asynchronous operations.

 > "Producing code" is code that can take some time
 > "Consuming code" is code that must wait for the result

 Promise object : There are 3 objects-
 1. Pending
 2. Fulfilled
 3. Rejected

 The Promise object supports two properties: state and result.

 While a Promise object is "pending" (working), the result is undefined.

 When a Promise object is "fulfilled", the result is a value.

 When a Promise object is "rejected", the result is an error object.


  ***** You cannot access the Promise properties state and result.

  ***** You must use a Promise method to handle promises.

 use a Promise: 
  myPromise.then(
  function(value) { /* code if successful */ },
  function(error) { /* code if some error */ }
  );
